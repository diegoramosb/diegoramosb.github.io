                <p>Throughout my career, I've worked in several projects. The most remarkable ones are the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/ngaitan98/CookIA">CookIA</a>: A mobile cooking application
                        developed in the Ionic framweork with an
                        integrated
                        voice assistant that is like Siri for cooking.
                        This was the middle-of-degree project that I participated in. <br>
                        For this project, we also paid special attention to the viability of a start-up. Looking into
                        thins as early adopter interviews and usability tests.

                    <li><a href="https://github.com/diegoramosb/In_Rainbows">In_Rainbows</a>: This is still an unnamed
                        project. It is a mobile application
                        developed in
                        Java that has the goal
                        to help students track and organize their time. As of today, it has time tracking per subject
                        and a tool to register grades.
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/diegoramosb/diegoramosb.github.io">This website</a>: Although I've
                        done web developing before, this is my first time
                        designing the front-end of a webpage.

                <p>Relating to my degree, I enjoy learning about the development of new tech. On the other hand,
                    programming is an activity that entertains me.</p>
                <p>I play chess sometimes, although I'm not that good at it. <a href="https://lichess.org/@/Droeek">This
                        is my Lichess profile.</a></p>
                <p>One of my biggest hobbies is playing videogames. My all time favourites are Age Of Empires II,
                    Cities Skylines and Hollow Knight.</p>
                <p>I really enjoy reading! <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84034642-diego">This is my
                        Goodreads profile</a>, where I try to keep track of the books that I have read, am currently
                    reading and want to read.</p>

                <h2 id="academic">Academic formation and experience</h2>
                <p>I graduated from highscool from Colegio Claustro Moderno in Bogotá in 2015. I started studying my
                    degree in Systems and Computing Engineering
                    at Universidad de Los Andes In Bogotá in August 2016. In these years, I've made learning projects
                    on data
                    structures, SQL databases, web developing and software architecture.
                </p>
                <p>I don't have any working experience related to my degree yet. But I'm planning to do an internship
                    next year with the objective of gaining experience in a working environment.</p>

                <h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
                <p>Most of the proramming that I've don has been in Java. Therefore, I consider myself proficient at
                    it.
                    Additionally, I have knowledge of relational databases, software architecture, and server
                    infrastructure.
                    I also have teamwork experience, since I have done at least three big academic programming projects
                    in different subjects with a team. With good results overall.
