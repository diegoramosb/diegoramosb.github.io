        <h1 id="home">WELCOME TO DIEGO RAMOS' WEBSITE</h1>
        <h2 id="info">Personal information</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Diego Ramos, I'm a 20 years old Systems and Computing Engineering student at Universidad de Los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia.
        </p>
        <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
        <p>Throughout my career, I've worked in several projects. The most remarkable ones are the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="">CookIA</a>: A mobile cooking application developed in the Ionic framweork with an integrated voice assistant that is like Siri for cooking.
            This was the middle-of-degree project that I participated in.</li>
            <li><a href="">In_Rainbows</a>: This is still an unnamed project. It is a mobile application developed in Java that has the goal
            to help students track and organize their time. As of today, it has time tracking per subject and a tool to register grades.</li>
            <li><a href="">This website</a>: Although I've done web developing before, this is my first time designing the front-end of a webpage.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
        <p>I am interested in techonology and programming.</p>
        <p>I play chess sometimes, although I'm not that good at it. <a href="https://lichess.org/@/Droeek">This is my Lichess profile.</a></p>
        <p>One of my biggest hobbies is playing videogames.</p>
        <p>I really enjoy reading! <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84034642-diego">This is my Goodreads profile</a>, where I try to keep track of the books that I have read, am currently reading and want to read.</p>
        <h2 id="academic">Academic formation and experience</h2>
        <p>I graduated from highscool from Colegio Claustro Moderno in Bogotá. I started studying my degree in Systems and Computing Engineering 
            at Universidad de Los Andes In Bogotá in August 2016. In these years, I've made learning projects on data structures, SQL databases, web developing and software architecture.
         </p>
         <p>I don't have any working experience related to my degree yet. But I'm planning to do an internship in the next year with the objective of gaining experience in a working environment.</p>

        <h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
        <p>Most of the proramming that I've don has been in Java. Therefore, I consider myself proficient at it. Additionally, I have knowledge of relational databases, software architecture, and server infrastructure.
            I also have teamwork experience, since I have done at least three big projects with a team.
